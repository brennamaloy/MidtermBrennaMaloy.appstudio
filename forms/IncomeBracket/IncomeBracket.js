/* Created a new form named incomeBracket.
Used the design shown above. 
Used Bootstrap4 input, label, and button controls. 
All controls are named appropriately like we did in class (button: btnSomeName).
NO alerts, prompts, confirms, or console.logs used.
Got income from user using a control. 
Used at least one if/else statement.
Used at least one boolean operator. 
Used this format for output into a control using a template literal.
    Example: say the user input:  100000. The output would be:
             "With your income of $100000, you are in a tax bracket of 25%"
Code is all commented out. 
Program runs without error.
